### Abstract
Low grade gliomas are sub-types of cancer that develops in the glial cells of the brain, which are fatal diseases happen world-wildly. In this study, the genetic biomarkers' expression Z scores and clinical data from electronic health record in TCGA-LGG are used as the databases to build machine learning models on. After a missing data imputation and a brief data pre-processing, feature selection methods including partial least square and principal component regression are used to reduce the dimension of the database. Then, classifier including logistic regression, random forest and convolutional neural network are applied to predict the glioma mortality in patient. The result shows that genetic information is persuasive enough in predicting glioma mortality.  Clinical data could be helpful only in some of the cases. And CNN model performs the best to make a decent prediction on patient glioma mortality.

### Introduction
All the code related to this program we have already pushed on this branch, one notebook is genetic dataset, the other is genetic and clinical dataset. The data we use is listed in the branch, we also mentioned in our paper and poster.
